         In Underlord you build a dungeon and 
         defend your head against waves of heroes.
         You increase your score by defeating heroes.
         The game ends when your head is destroyed 
         or you quit per menu.
         If your score is high enough it gets saved 
         as higescore.
         Ingame you find helpbuttons(?) which 
         explain the gamemechanics. In the 
         Settings you can disable them anytime
         you want. 
         The camera can be rotated by Q and E.
         To move the camera use W, A, S and D.          
         Would you liek to play with help?
         Have fun.
